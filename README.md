## Purpose of project
I wanted to practise my React skills with browser routing, generating dynamic forms, and passing states between pages.

## What I learnt 
- React browser routing
- passing states on navigating to a different page using the useNavigation and useLocation hooks.
- posting to a third part API.
- how to save an image given it's url.

## Things to improve on
- Integrate social media share features
- Add a search field where a user can filter by a meme's name
